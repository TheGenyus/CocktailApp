Hello i would like to know if it's possible for you to make me a simple app to make cocktails.
This app would be used in order to make cocktails and it will list numerous recipy.
I would like to make this app within android studio and it would be appreciated if you could make me a small tutorial on how should i use it in order to build your app.

So a cocktail contains the following information:

- A name
- A list of ingredient with dosage
- An expert rating
- The rating of the user
- A description of the flavour
- The history of the cocktail

The app should contain the following features:

- Search for a specific cocktail by name
- List all cocktails
- List all cocktails already done by the user
- A user can put a recipy in his favorites
- List all favorites of a user
- Randomly select a recipy with user preferences (flavour)
- Randomly select a recipy with user ingredients
- List some tutorials on how to make cocktails
- Make it so a user can rate a cocktail
- List all cocktails that the user can make with his ingredients
- List all cocktails that the user would like (cocktail flavour search)

The main menu of the app is the login menu then the app should contain a menu with X Buttons:

- List favorites
- List recipes already done
- search (find a cocktail with different specification like name, flavour, the ingredients, etc)
- Random select (With user preference or not or user ingredients or not)
- List tutorials
- Disconnect

When a user search for a recipy he can select it to check for the details of it and can then rate it.

I also want a detailed step by step tutorial on exactly what i should do and which files i should create and where i should create them for every functionnality
